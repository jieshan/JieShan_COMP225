Snake
===============
This application is a modification on the 2.3.3 Android Sample Project: Snake. All changes are made in SnakeView.java.

Original Features
-----------------

In a normal Snake game, a snake would become longer and move faster after eating an apple (yellow). Running into itself or the walls will end the game.
Scores are calculated based on the number of apples eaten.

Modifications
-------------

Now in the garden, life candies are added (green).
