Snake
===============
This application is a modification on the 2.3.3 Android Sample Project: Snake. All changes are made in SnakeView.java.

Original Features
-----------------

In a normal Snake game, a snake would become longer and move faster after eating an apple (yellow). Running into itself or the walls will end the game.
Score is calculated based on the number of apples eaten. There are two apples in the garden all the time.

Modifications
-------------

Now in the garden, life candies are added (green). After eating a life candy, the snake would shrink, but would still move faster.
Also, the number of life candies eaten does not count towards score. There is only one life candy in the garden all the time.
